This repository is a catalog of common design patterns used for Object-Oriented Design implemented in Java.
Patterns are divided into 3 subdirectories based on their purpose:
    1. Behavioral Patterns - Patterns dealing with the ways objects or classes interact and distribute responsibility.
    2. Creational Patterns - Patterns related to the creation of classes or objects.
    3. Structural Patterns - Patterns related to the composition of classes or objects.
